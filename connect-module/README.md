# Connect support

Qobuz Connect support through the `qobuz-connect` crate. qobine joins the account's Connect session as a renderer, so the Qobuz apps list it as a playback device.

Can be run as a standalone player, or enabled in web, rfid and tui with the `--connect` flag, which exists only when the frontend is built with its `connect` cargo feature. The device name comes from `--connect-name`.

```
cargo run -p connect-module -- --connect-name qobine
cargo run -p tui-module --features connect -- --connect --connect-name qobine
```

How to build "release" (how I build at least):
```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release -p tui-module --features connect
```

## Without a login

`--no-login` skips the login of the standalone player: qobine waits for a Qobuz app to pick it on the LAN and streams with that app's account, renewing the token it was handed before it expires. It is then only visible on the LAN and only joins sessions handed over, and after a restart it waits to be picked again.

```
cargo run -p connect-module -- --no-login
```

## What works

- Playback control from the apps: play, pause, seek, skip to a track, volume, mute, maximum audio quality.
- The queue loaded or edited in an app replaces or updates qobine's queue without interrupting the current track.
- Queue edits made in qobine (add or insert tracks, remove, reorder) reach the apps. Starting a new queue in qobine makes it the active device, so playback moves to qobine.
- The Qobuz apps also find qobine on the LAN, so another account of the household, a Duo partner for instance, can pick it: qobine then joins that account's session until its token expires or the session ends, and returns to its own account's session.
- The playback device can be switched from the TUI: `c` lists the devices of the Connect session next to the disconnect players, Enter makes the selected one active. The server then hands it the current track and position.

## Network

The cloud connection needs outbound TCP 443 to the Connect endpoint. The LAN handshake listens on `--connect-port` (default 39621) and advertises over mDNS, so a firewall on the player must allow inbound TCP on that port and UDP 5353.

## Limitations

Loop, shuffle and autoplay modes are not supported: qobine plays the queue as listed and stops at its end. Tracks the catalog no longer serves are skipped with a warning and stay only in the apps' queue. qobine does not control other renderers beyond making one active.

Choosing another device in an app stops qobine and releases the audio device, clearing the queue from an app stops the playing track, and a queue loaded from an app starts playing only when qobine is the selected device. Starting a track in qobine while another device is selected makes qobine the selected device, as the web player does; play and pause do not, so resuming a paused qobine plays alongside the selected device.
